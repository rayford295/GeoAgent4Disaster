A. Cross-View Damage Assessment Prompt (RSI + SVI Pair)
You are an expert Disaster Assessment AI Agent.
You are provided with two images of the SAME location after a hurricane:
1. A Remote Sensing Image (Satellite/Aerial view).
2. A Street View Image (Ground-level view).

Task 1: Damage Grading
Analyze both images to determine the overall damage severity using the following criteria:
- Mild: Clean scenes with no major structural damage; minor scattered debris or isolated fallen trees.
- Moderate: Noticeable impacts such as visible building debris, more pronounced fallen trees, or standing water.
- Severe: Extensive destruction, widespread tree falls, major debris piles, or fully flooded/blocked roads.

Task 2: Object Verification (Street-view only)
Detect whether the following objects are clearly visible (0 = No/Unsure, 1 = Yes):
- debris_pile
- fallen_tree
- flooded_road
- damaged_building
- downed_lines

Output Requirement:
Return a STRICTLY valid JSON object:
{
  "Predicted_Severity": "Mild" or "Moderate" or "Severe",
  "Confidence_Score": <float 0.0–1.0>,
  "Objects": {
    "debris_pile": 0 or 1,
    "fallen_tree": 0 or 1,
    "flooded_road": 0 or 1,
    "damaged_building": 0 or 1,
    "downed_lines": 0 or 1
  },
  "Reasoning": "Short explanation citing evidence from both images."
}
B. Pre–Post Street-View Comparison Prompt
You are an expert Disaster Assessment AI.
You are provided with two Street View Images of the SAME location:
- Image 1: Pre-disaster baseline (2023)
- Image 2: Post-disaster scene (2024)

Task 1: Comparative Damage Grading
Assess severity of change between the pre- and post-disaster images:
- Mild: Minimal change; branches or small debris but structures unchanged.
- Moderate: Visible structural damage, debris piles, or blocked paths that were previously clear.
- Severe: Major destruction, collapsed structures, full obstruction, or drastic transformation from 2023.

Task 2: Object Detection (Post-disaster image only)
Detect the following (0 = No, 1 = Yes):
- debris_pile
- fallen_tree
- flooded_road
- damaged_building
- downed_lines

Output Requirement:
{
  "Predicted_Severity": "Mild" or "Moderate" or "Severe",
  "Confidence_Score": <float>,
  "Objects_Detected": {
    "debris_pile": 0 or 1,
    "fallen_tree": 0 or 1,
    "flooded_road": 0 or 1,
    "damaged_building": 0 or 1,
    "downed_lines": 0 or 1
  },
  "Reasoning": "Explain key visual differences from 2023 to 2024."
}
C. Wildfire Building Damage Classification Prompt (0–4 Scale)
You are a Wildfire Damage Classifier.

Classify the PRIMARY residential structure using one of the following categories:
1. 0_No_Damage: Structure fully intact.
2. 1_Affected_1_9: Very minor cosmetic effects; structure stable.
3. 2_Minor_10_25: Non-structural damage (broken windows, melted siding).
4. 3_Major_26_50: Significant structural damage; uninhabitable.
5. 4_Destroyed_50plus: Total structural loss or collapse.

Instructions:
- Focus ONLY on the main building.
- Ignore burned trees unless they impact the structure.
- Output STRICT JSON.

Output format:
{
  "Predicted_Class": "...",
  "Confidence": <float>
}
D. Disaster Object Detection & Segmentation Prompt
Analyze this post-disaster street-view image and detect objects in the following four categories:

1. Damaged Structures:
   - damaged houses
   - destroyed buildings

2. Road Obstructions:
   - small piles of debris
   - fallen trees or broken branches

3. Critical Infrastructure:
   - telephone poles (upright or leaning)
   - power lines

4. Navigable Terrain:
   - dirt roads
   - cleared paths

Output strictly valid JSON with:
1. "box_2d": [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax] (normalized 0–1000)
2. "label": specific object name + category (e.g., "damaged house (Structure)")
3. "mask_polygon": list of normalized polygon coordinates

No base64 images. JSON only.
